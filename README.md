![Project Preview](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Overview

This repository contains my solution for the QR Card project from Frontend Mentor. The project involved creating a non-responsive QR card using HTML and CSS. This README provides an overview of the project, the features implemented, and how to set it up locally.

## Features

- **Non-Responsive QR Card:** The project focuses on creating a non-responsive QR card design. It showcases the use of HTML and CSS to style and structure the QR card.
- **Static Design:** The design is intended to be a static representation of a QR card. While it doesn't include responsive features, it demonstrates my understanding of basic HTML and CSS concepts.
